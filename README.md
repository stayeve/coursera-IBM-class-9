# A description of the problem and a discussion of the background
*   It is an art to find a suitable place for a restaurant. Good location represents a large number of customers and a steady stream of money.  
*   We used to choose position by handcraft, but now, with the machine learning technology, we can complete it by computer.
*   This project aims to help who is looking to open a restaurant in **San Francisco**. Where is the best place that they open it? Where can meet more customers needs? Where have more potential customers?

# A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem.
*   The data from Foursquare, which include the geographical coordinates of restarants, malls, schools, etc. We try to utilize it to find customer groups and cluster the place and find the best position.
*   We also have district data of San Francisco that can help us show our result. There will be a clear look on the map
